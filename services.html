                    <h3>What is Prolotherapy?</h3>
                    <p>Prolotherapy, also known as proliferative therapy, is a regenerative injection treatment that stimulates the body's natural healing process to strengthen and repair injured and painful joints, ligaments, and tendons.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <ol class="prolo-steps">
                        <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Thorough examination to identify damaged or weakened tissues</li>
                        <li><strong>Injection:</strong> Natural solution injected into affected ligaments and tendons</li>
                        <li><strong>Healing Response:</strong> Body responds by increasing blood flow and stimulating repair</li>
                        <li><strong>Strengthening:</strong> New collagen fibers form, strengthening the treated area</li>
                        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Gradual reduction in pain and improvement in function over weeks</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Benefits of Prolotherapy</h3>
                    <ul class="benefits-list">
                        <li>Non-surgical, minimally invasive procedure</li>
                        <li>Treats the root cause, not just symptoms</li>
                        <li>Promotes natural tissue regeneration</li>
                        <li>Minimal downtime and recovery</li>
                        <li>Long-lasting results</li>
                        <li>Alternative to surgery and long-term medication</li>
                        <li>Can be combined with other therapies</li>
                        <li>Suitable for multiple areas of the body</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Who Can Benefit?</h3>
                    <p>Prolotherapy is ideal for patients experiencing chronic pain from ligament or tendon injuries, arthritis, sports injuries, and degenerative conditions who wish to avoid surgery. It's particularly effective for:</p>
                    <ul class="benefits-list">
                        <li>Chronic joint pain and instability</li>
                        <li>Sports-related injuries</li>
                        <li>Ligament and tendon injuries</li>
                        <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
                        <li>Back and neck pain</li>
                        <li>Failed previous treatments</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                    <p>Most patients require 3-6 treatment sessions spaced 3-6 weeks apart. You may experience mild soreness for a few days after treatment, which is a sign that the healing process has been activated. Improvement is typically gradual, with most patients noticing significant relief within 3-6 months.</p>
