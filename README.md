# Vercel Deployment Guide

This project is a static website (HTML/CSS/JS). Two common ways to make it live on Vercel are shown below:

## Option A — Deploy from GitHub (recommended for continuous deployments)

1. Initialize git and create a commit (run in the project folder):

   ```cmd
   cd "c:\Users\ES 1\Downloads\MedicalWebsite1"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial site files"
   ```

2. Create a GitHub repository (use the website or `gh` CLI). Then add the remote and push:

   ```cmd
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Go to https://vercel.com, sign up (or log in), click "New Project" → "Import Git Repository" → choose your repo → Deploy. Vercel will detect this as a static site.

## Option B — Deploy directly from your machine with the Vercel CLI

1. Install Node.js (if not installed). Then install the Vercel CLI globally:

   ```cmd
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login and deploy (run in the project folder):

   ```cmd
   cd "c:\Users\ES 1\Downloads\MedicalWebsite1"
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

   The CLI will ask a couple of questions (project name, scope). Confirm defaults or enter values.

## Custom domain (optional)

- After deploy, in the Vercel dashboard you can add a custom domain (e.g., example.com). Follow Vercel's DNS instructions to point your domain.

## Notes & troubleshooting

- This is a static site — Vercel will serve files from the repository root. No build step needed.
- If you prefer automated settings, the included `vercel.json` explicitly uses the static builder.
- If you push changes to `main` (or the branch you configured), Vercel will redeploy automatically.

Files added to help deploy:

- `vercel.json` — minimal Vercel configuration forcing the static builder
- `.vercelignore` — keeps large/irrelevant files out of deployments

If you want, I can also:

- Initialize a local git repo and create the first commit for you (I can't push to your GitHub or run the Vercel CLI from here).
- Generate a simple `package.json` if you plan to use Node tooling.

Tell me which deployment route you want (GitHub or CLI) and I will give the exact next commands or create the git commit locally for you to run.
